RandomGift
==========

###Description

RandomGift randomly rewards a lucky online player with a gift when another
player logs into the game. Using this plugin encourages people to play and spend
time on the server regularly throughout the day as they are rewarded for doing
so.

RandomGift is fully configurable, including the item pool, minimum players
required to use it and amount of time between each gift chance.

###Notes
**Update check**

The version of the plugin is automatically checked against the latest available
when you start up the server to see if an update is available, this
functionality can be disabled in the configuration file.

**Data collection**

RandomGift uses Plugin Metrics that collects anonymous statistic data about the
plugins usage and sends it to [http://mcstats.org/plugin/randomgift](http://mcstats.org/plugin/randomgift)

RandomGift also sends its current version number back to its developer for
statistical purposes. This information is simply used for tracking current
versions in use, and the data collected will only be seen by the developer(s).

*If you prefer, you can disable both the Plugin Metrics and sending of version
data inside the configuration file as seen above. You can also disable Plugin
Metrics globally inside its own configuration located at /plugins/Plugin
Metrics/config.yml*
